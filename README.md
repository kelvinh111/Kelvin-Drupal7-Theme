Kelvin Theme
=========

This is a very clean theme for [Drupal 7](https://drupal.org).

Using
-----
  - SCSS & Compass (have to compile them yourself)
  - jQuery 1.10.2 (frontend only)
  - cssrefresh.js to monitor changes of .css files
  - hasChanged.js to monitor changes of DOM elements

NOT using
-----
  - .info to load external css & js, just simply add them into html.tpl.php
  - base-theme
  - theme-settings.php for backend panel
  - too many regions

Usage
-----
Just throw into project theme folder and enable it in Drupal.

Notes
-----
  - Edit config.rb for the SCSS & Compass compilation setting.
  - If you wanna use grid, I'd prefer [Compass's Blueprint Grid](http://compass-style.org/reference/blueprint/grid/).
  - Not so many files/code, you may spend some time going through them and then you can figure out wht's going on... or hit me a mail.
